<h1> The Fame </h1>
<body>
 After running around NYC as a freshly graduated high schooler, Gaga's parents gave her one year to get a record deal. Gaga got the record deal, but was shortly dropped before she could release anything. In 2007, Interscope Records signed her, the rest is history. She went on to release her debut album titled "The Fame". This album sprung off hits such as "Just Dance," "Poker Face," and "Paparazzi". This album is one of the most iconic debuts to date, it only got bigger from here.
