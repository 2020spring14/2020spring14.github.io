<h1> Born This Way </h1>
<body>
 In 2011, Lady Gaga releassed her highly anticipated 3rd studio album titled "Born This Way". This album sonically is much different than her last two, while still being a dance-pop masterpiece, it explores gritty euro-techno sounds, heavy metal drums and guitars, ochestral choirs, and disco strings. The single "Born This Way" was a massive success and the first song to hit number one while explicitly mentioning and shouting-out the LGBTQ+ community. Gaga truly changed the world with this song and the album. Gaga sings about being an outcast on this album, about her struggles in high school, but also her little monsters (fans) struggles. The song "Hair" directly takes from expiriences both her and her monsters have dealt with. This album radiates love and acceptence and is a huge milestone in music.
