<h1> Chromatica </h1>
<body>
Just last week, Lady Gaga releassed her 6th album titled "Chromatica". Chromatica is a return to her dance-pop roots, incorporating sonics from 90's house, 80's synth pop, and disco. This album is a full expeirence, with 3 orchestral interludes that blend into eachother seamlesly. "Chromatica" is also a hyperpop escapist "planet" that Gaga is exploring and sharing through her visuals and videos. While Gaga was creating this album she was suffering major mental and physical health issues, she says that creating this album healed her. While the sonics are extremely happy and poppy, the lyrics are very somber yet perfectly catchy. The album also includes star-studded collaboraters such as pop princess Ariana Grande, Elton John, K-Pop group Blackpink.
