<h1> Joanne </h1>
<body>
  After her Artrave: The Artpop Ball Tour, dueting with Tony Bennett, and staring in "American Horror Story," Gaga started working on her 5th studio album. The album allegedly started off as a dark-pop album, but quickly took a turn. Joanne is a country-pop album that she said was basically written for her father. Gaga's dad lost his sister Joanne from lupus when she was only 19 years old, Gaga wanted to help heal him. The album is extremely stripped back, but still has it's fun moments. "Joanne" sprung off the hit "Million Reasons," and around this time Gaga booked her role as Ally in the 2018 rendition of "A Star Is Born". This era also gave us Gaga's iconic 2017 Super Bowl performance.
