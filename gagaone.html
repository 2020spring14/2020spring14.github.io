<h1> A Trip Through Lady Gaga's Album Discography </h1>
<body>
  Stefani Germanotta, better known as Lady Gaga, is one of music's most beloved artists. She came bursting onto the scene over a decade ago, and her star has only gotten bigger. She is known for her eclectic music, performances, and fashion, but also her humanitarianism. I will be giving you a tour of her solo album discography, it will not include 2014's jazz duet album with Tony Bennet titled "Cheek To Cheek," or the soundtrack to the Oscar winning "A Star Is Born".
