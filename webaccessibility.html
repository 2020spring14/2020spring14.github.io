<h2> what is web accessibility? </h2> 

<ul>
<li>
having web pages that are accessible to everyone is extremely important. the sad truth is, many webpages are not equipped for those with impaired vision. an estimated 285 million people in the world are visually impaired, including poor eyesight, blindness, and color blindness. thankfully, webpages are becoming more accessible for the impaired. there are now websites that will quickly convert a webpage for the imapired and websites created with everybody in mind.  
  </li>
</ul>
