<h1> Artpop </h1>
<body>
By 2012, Gaga had to cut her Born This Way Ball Tour short because she broke her hip dancing. This was extremely traumatic for her and it led her to suffer with fibromyalgia. Gaga let out to write an album almost the opposite of Andy Warhol... she mixed art with pop (something she is known for) opposed to mixing pop with art. The album was extremely ahead of it's time, mixing her trademarked dance-pop with edm, trap, house, and soul. Gaga was extremely depressed while creating this album and her depression got worse when the album commercially "floped". Although the fans loved it, the charts didn't. She still went on to do massive performances, her shine hadn't dulled, it was just a shame her hardwork went pretty unnoticed. Had this album been releassed 5 years later, critics think it would have done extremely well.
