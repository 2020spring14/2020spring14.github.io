	<h2> The Golden Rules of The Internet</h2>
		</em>
	<ul> 
		<li> Caution is needed to stay safe on the internet. 
		Weather it be making sure you're cautious of what you are sharing with the world or how you treat others. You make think that once something is deleted it is gone... that is not the case. You leave a digital footprint once you post or even send something on the internet, so be extremely careful. Do not talk to strangers, even if they seem to have the same interests in you. Although not always the case, predators will disguise themselves as teens you can identify with. 
		</li>
		<li> Make sure you think before you post anything. People can take your posts out of context and create a drama around what you said. Don't post any indirect shade, keep that conversation between you and your friends. By posting indirect shade, anyone who follows you will be wondering who it is about and can take it to the school if they think it is a form of bullying... even if you were just posting about a celebrity you don't like. Also make sure to not post any photos that may be incriminating down the line. Maybe you post a picture or meme you think is funny when you're an imature 12 year old and someone uses it against you when you're 22 and trying to get a job, always keep the future in mind.
